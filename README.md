# KSZ-cross-correlation-2019

In this project we study kSZ(kinematic Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich) effect by cross correlate galaxy catalogs with tSZ-free CMB map. Based on that, we try to place constraints on the tension over hubble constant if we lives inside of a underdensed 'local void', and hopefully, give hints to rule out that "local bubble theory".

This is an on-going project! All results are not polished nicely yet. Espeically the first plot presents the result in a werid way...
